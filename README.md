## Available Scripts

I have included Blogs, AboutUs, and login button inside the navbar. Through out the whole project 
I have used both bootstrap and vanilla css where I saw fit. 
<li>Clicking on the page title will redirect you to the homepage</li>
<li>On the homepage, I have added navbar, a static image as my banner, a section which includes services, reviews and a footer</li>
<li>There is a button on the banner which upon clicked will take you to the service section</li>
<li>I have used requireAuth to make the checkout route private with firebase hooks.</li>
<li>You can signup with your email and password. Also you can signin directly with google sign in. All these functionality I have implemented is through firebase hooks.</li>
<li>The login page will show errors if your email, and password inputs are empty, if you have put the wrong password. If your login is successful it will navigate you back to the checkout page and show a toast saying login successful. A reset password has been set.</li>
<li>The signup page will show errors if your inputs are empty, if the password doesnt match with the confirm password. If the signup is successful a toast will appear with a successful signup message. A verfication email will be sent after you have signed up.</li>
<li>On my blogs page I have attempted to answer a few questions.</li>
<li>On the About us page I have written about my mindset more than I have written about myself, hope it will be accepted nevertheless.</li>
<li>The checkout page to your disappoinment is empty.</li>

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
