## A walk through on my project
I have included Blogs, AboutUs, and login button inside the navbar. Through out the whole project 
I have used both bootstrap and vanilla css where I saw fit. 
<li>Clicking on the page title will redirect you to the homepage</li>
<li>On the homepage, I have added navbar, a static image as my banner, a section which includes services, reviews and a footer</li>
<li>There is a button on the banner which upon clicked will take you to the service section</li>
<li>I have used requireAuth to make the checkout route private with firebase hooks.</li>
<li>You can signup with your email and password. Also you can signin directly with google sign in. All these functionality I have implemented is through firebase hooks.</li>
<li>The login page will show errors if your email, and password inputs are empty, if you have put the wrong password. If your login is successful it will navigate you back to the checkout page and show a toast saying login successful. A reset password has been set.</li>
<li>The signup page will show errors if your inputs are empty, if the password doesnt match with the confirm password. If the signup is successful a toast will appear with a successful signup message. A verfication email will be sent after you have signed up.</li>
<li>On my blogs page I have attempted to answer a few questions.</li>
<li>On the About us page I have written about my mindset more than I have written about myself, hope it will be accepted nevertheless.</li>
<li>The checkout page to your disappoinment is empty.</li>
